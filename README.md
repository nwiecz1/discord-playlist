# discord-playlist
Connect to a server and plays songs off of a playlist instead of queueing up songs one at a time.  I usually run this directly for intellij...but you can make an executable if you want

$create playlist_name to create a playlist

$add playlist_name "song name" "youtube link" to save the song to a playlist

$play playlist to play it

Add a .env file to playlist/ that contains the discord token to get started

Uses python 3.8.3
